    <h3> Smart Elevators </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> OOP,Java</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The project focuses on the challenge of optimizing elevator scheduling.
      Given a call for the elevator from the source floor to the destination floor - the system will want to schedule the elevator that will minimize the arrival time. More generally, it is said that given a collection of calls to elevators in time, we would like to define a strategy for assigning elevators to calls that will minimize the total arrival time for all the calls.</p>

    <h3> Pokemon game </h3>
    <p> This project displays a simple pokemon game. You have pokemon collectors (agents) and pokemons on weighed edges. We must catch as many pokemons as we can.

      The main "code" in here is the complexity of finding the shortestPath to a pokemon with as low runing time as we can.</p>
